"You are in your room, playing your favourite game.  The lights go out, everything is dark.  You reach for your phone on the bedside stand. You want to start the Torch app. Something is wrong, the phone is also off."

First submission, just one room was able to complete.

Future builds to include:
* A complete first level house plan, inluding the second bedroom, bathroom, open plan kitchen with lounge/playroom/lounge.
* As the player, you are stuck in your own room, unable to come out because you designed the security of your home in that way, to not allow intruders.
* The player will have to go through each challenge to escape each room.
* Along the way, finding objects, for example candles to direct your way, to eventually make it out of your own secured home.
